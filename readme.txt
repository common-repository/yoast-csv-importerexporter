Gives WordPress SEO by Yoast a CSV import & export support so you can update your site's SEO data in bulk.

== Description ==
A plugin that gives <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> a CSV Import & Export support. With this plugin, you can export and import a large CSV file containing your site's SEO meta data into your WordPress site that has WordPress SEO by Yoast installed. 

= When is it useful? =

This plugin comes in handy when you want to mass-update your site's SEO meta data and you don't want to do it one by one. You can import a CSV file instead and your SEO data will be updated in seconds.

Special thanks to graphic genius <a href="http://nicoalumbro.com" target="_blank">Nico Alumbro</a> for helping me creating the icon & banners. 

== Installation ==
1. Upload the <code>yoast-csv-import-export</code> folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the <code>WordPress SEO by Yoast CSV Importer/Exporter</code> plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Import / Export your CSV by going to **Settings** > **CSV Import/Export**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I tried to export my site's SEO data but when I press "Export" button, nothing happens. Why is it so? =
This plugin heavily relies on JavaScript. If one of your plugins has JavaScript errors (you can see that in the console), then, this plugin may not work as expected.

== Screenshots ==
1. The default page. Here you can upload your CSV file to start the import process.
2. You'll be taken to this page once the CSV file has been uploaded. This is where the magic happens; you can drag items from the right to the textboxes in the left. The items on the right are basically the "columns" detected on your CSV file.
3. The export tab. Here you can specify the post types you want to export
